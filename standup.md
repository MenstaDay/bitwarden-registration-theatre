# Bitwarden Stand-Up (English)

Hello, Bitwarden team. My name is Julia — but some people call me a security theatre critic.

*(pause)*

The other day I decided: Enough! No more passwords in Telegram. Time to grow up. Be proper. Be like everybody else.
I downloaded Bitwarden. I was ready to create a master password. To finally live in peace.

I entered my email on my iPad. App said: "Check your inbox."
Fair enough. Except… my email was on my phone.

Because I’m not the type who enables Mail on all devices. I’m the type who has a system.

*(smirking)*

So I open the confirmation link on my phone.
And Bitwarden goes:
> “Oh, you're on a different device? Never mind. Come in. Set your master password.”

My. Master. Password.

And after I submit it?
> “Oops! Who are you again?”

Excuse me?! I’m the person who just gave you the key to my digital soul!
And you toss me into the void of broken registration flows?!

*(pause, serious tone)*

Bitwarden, darling. If your security model is Swiss Vault-level… maybe learn to distinguish between an iPad and an iPhone before protecting my life.

“Registration must be completed on the same device.”

Fine. Then don’t let me get halfway there on another.
You can’t have it both ways. You’re not Schrödinger’s UX.

I wrote to support. Politely. In full sentences. No caps lock.
Their answer?
> “Please check our help center.”

Check your help center?!
No, dear Bitwarden. Please check your architecture.

*(soft tone)*

At least Telegram never pretended to be smarter than me.
And it was always… on the same device as I was.

Thank you.
